# How the program should run
# 
# Welcome screen
# - This app does these things:
#   - Sends allocation emails to students
#   (that's it for now)
#   (other things to come)
#
# Should present the options as a radio buttons and then continue
#
# Allocations mailings flow:
# - first, user must upload spreadheet.  Explain the spreadsheet must be as follows:
#   - Must be an Excel spreadsheet save as a .xlsx file
#   - Must contain either a single tab, or if it contains multiple tabs then it must
#     contain a tab called 'Student Allocations Mailing DB'
#   - The single tab (or the SAMDB tab) must be formatted as follows:
#     (lay out the columns)
#     (include a screenshot of an example?)
#     (include an example spreadsheeet template to complete (or to past into an
#     existing spreadsheet))
#
# - Then we use Pandas to process the xlsx, find the tab and validate it.
#   - validation is:
#     - check for tab (if not single tab)
#     - check columns named correctly
#     - check there is at least one data row
#   - if validation fails we should return the user to the upload screen so they
#     can have another go.
#
# - Once we have a spreadsheet uploaded we need to verify the data to put into the form
#   letter.  This data is:
#   - confirmation date
#   - reply email addresses (one for FLC, one for the TC)
#   - cc: email addresses 
#   - Date of general induction
#   - (optional) link to Induction module in Canvas
#   - GI location (default FLC)
#   - GI start time (default 8:45am)
#   - SI start date (from spreadsheet)
#   - SI start time (default: 8:45am)
#   - SI location (default FLC)
#   - First week of semester
#   -
